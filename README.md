Animal Rites
============

A top-down, 2D, adorable game about sacrificing as many cute animals as possible, by carefully choosing the right combination of ritual items for each animal.  If you use the right items every time you can beat the game, but if you choose the wrong items, you have to start all over again, using your previous experience to do better.  

Hints:
- Each item can only be used once!
- You can use up to 5 items each round, but you often won't need that many.
- You'll need to play through the game many times to figure out the right combinations of items.
- Some successful sacrifices will give you bonus items that you will need later.
- Many combinations of items will let you successfully sacrifice each animal, but only one combination per animal will allow you to beat the game.  Pay careful attention to the "feedback bunnies" after each round.  If they cheer you on, you know you used the right combination, but if they mock you, it means you've used up some items that you will need later to beat the game.
